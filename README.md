An end-to-end data analysis and visualization project based on the GameZone order dataset. This project explores global sales trends, top products, revenue channels, and platform preferences through a modern dashboard built in Python and Power BI.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset includes over **21,000 orders** from a e-commerce platform, GameZone, with details such as:

- Purchase and shipping timestamps  
- Product name and price  
- Platform used (website or mobile app)  
- Marketing channel (email, social, affiliate)  
- Country and user behavior data

##  Key Insights

- ### Top Product:
  The **27-inch 4K gaming monitor** was the best-selling product by revenue (~$1.9M), followed closely by the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5.

- ### Sales by Platform:
  More than **5 million USD in sales** came from **website users**, while mobile app purchases were minimal â€” revealing a gap/opportunity in mobile UX.

-  ### Marketing Channel Performance:  
  **Email** campaigns outperformed social media, generating over **$600K**, showing the effectiveness of direct marketing.

- ### Global Distribution:  
  North America, Europe, and parts of Asia are the strongest markets, indicating a global spread with high purchasing power in western regions.

- ### Time Trends: 
  Sales volume and order counts peaked in **November and December**, likely due to Black Friday and holiday campaigns.

- ### Data Observations:
